;;; skywave-gui-theme.el -- Custom Emacs Theme
;;; P.C. Shyamshankar "sykora" <sykora@lucentbeing.com>

;;; Commentary:

;;; This is a reasonable port of my vim colorscheme, which can be
;;; found in the vim section of my configuration repository. Some
;;; changes have been made, but they're fundamentally the same.

;;; This is the GUI version, where I make use of the windowing
;;; system's support for 24-bit colors. For the 256-color TTY version,
;;; see `skywave-tty-theme.el'.

;;; Overrides for non-built-in faces are done on an as-needed basis.

;;; Code:

(deftheme skywave-gui "The Skywave GUI Emacs Theme")
