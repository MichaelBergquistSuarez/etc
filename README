Hello, and welcome to my `~/etc`. This is where I put my configuration files,
for a large number of the programs I use on a regular basis. Most of the files
are commented, so they should be relatively easy to decipher.

Points of Interest:

    * Spectrum, my simple abstraction for managing 256-color codes in `zsh`, is
      in `zsh/functions/spectrum`.
    * My Colemak key-bindings for `vim` are in `vim/colemak.vim`.
    * My `vim` plugins are listed (indirectly) in the `.gitmodules` file, they
      are pulled in as separate repositories and managed by pathogen.
